# Introduction
For the first week of our OOP final project, our group officially began the development of DataMedic, a Python-based data cleaning library designed to assist students, beginners in data science, data scientists and analysts in diagnosing and treating common dataset issues. The library aims to embody key object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, composition, and the use of dunder methods. DataMedic will serve as a diagnostic and treatment tool that inspects, cleans, and reports on dataset health—offering a unique, medical-inspired approach to data quality management.

# Objectives for the Week
In Week 1, our team built the foundation for DataMedic, a Python software that inspects, diagnoses, and resolves common data quality concerns such as missing values, duplicate entries, and outliers. Laying the groundwork for everything that follows.

This week, our group developed the concept for our library and designed it utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. We designed our process for the following stages of development, created a UML diagram to visualize the class hierarchy, and set up a GitHub repository for collaboration. Members were assigned responsibilities, and We looked into current data cleaning methods for suggestions and references.
